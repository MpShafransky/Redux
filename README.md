_User Story_<br>
As a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform I want my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API so that my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem.

<br>

This e-commerce web application gives the user the ability to add items to their cart, delete items from their cart, along with updating the quantity of the product in their cart, prior to checkout.

<br>

The user can filter the products on Shop Shop via the categories located at the top of the screen (food, household supplies, electronics, books or toys).

<br>

The user must also sign up or login to the web application to proceed to the checkout page. The checkout process with this web app is handled by the Stripe payment platform. More information can be found here on Stripe: https://stripe.com/
